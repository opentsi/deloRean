# deloRean: Time Travel for Time Series Data (Experimental)
Manage versioned time series with R in a git based time series archive. 

- deloRean is a boilerplate for time series data archives / data archive factory, i.e., it provides automation to create data packages that take care of their versioning such ch.kof.globalbaro. 
- deloRean does history altering commits, hence used opentimeseries package to read data from archive. DON'T CLONE data archives.
- if you don't trust the opentimeseries initiative to do vintage updates the way you want, you can use our framework to create your own git based time series archives.
